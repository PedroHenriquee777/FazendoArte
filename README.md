# 🎨 Fazendo Arte – Crochet & Handicraft Marketplace

**Fazendo Arte** is a startup developed as part of the **Startup Management** course. It aims to build a simple, accessible, and functional online marketplace that connects artisans with buyers of handmade products, such as crochet items, embroidery, paintings, and other crafts.

## 💡 About the Startup

We believe in the value of handcrafted work and in generating income through art. However, many artisans face challenges in promoting and selling their creations. To address this, we created **Fazendo Arte**, an online platform that helps artisans showcase and sell their products more easily and directly.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The current version of the project includes only the **seller-side functionalities**. The buyer interface is planned for future development.

## 🌐 Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **HTML5** – page structure
- **CSS3** – styling and responsiveness
- **JavaScript** – client-side interactivity
- **ChartJS** - A JavaScript lib for interactive graphs

### Backend:
- **PHP** – server-side logic and data handling
- **MySQL** – relational database for storing data

## 🔧 Main Features

### ✅ Implemented:
- Artisan registration and login
- Product creation and management (image, title, description, price)
- Product listing by artisan
- Interactive graphs with metrics
- Database integration with PHP and MySQL

### 🕒 To be implemented:
- Buyer registration and product browsing
- Shopping cart and checkout system
- Order tracking and communication between buyer and seller
- Put the code in English for good practice
